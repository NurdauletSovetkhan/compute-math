USAGE EXAMPLES:

=== Option 1: Run Example Systems ===
When you select option 1, the program will automatically solve all 4 predefined systems:
- System 1: 3x3 Diagonally Dominant
- System 2: 3x3 Tridiagonal
- System 3: 4x4 Diagonally Dominant
- System 4: 2x2 Simple

=== Option 2: Enter Your Own System ===
Example input for a 2x2 system:
  2x + y = 5
  x + 3y = 8

Enter the size of the system (n x n): 2

Enter coefficient matrix A (2x2):
Row 1 (space-separated values): 2 1
Row 2 (space-separated values): 1 3

Enter constant vector b (2 values):
Space-separated values: 5 8

The program will then solve this system using both methods.

=== Option 3: Exit ===
Exit the program.

The menu will keep showing until you choose option 3 to exit.
